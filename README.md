# Wireless Sensor Networks (Redes de sensores inal치mbricos)
## About this course
The course introduces the student to the basic operating principles of wireless sensor networks, familiarizing them with current technologies for their implementation and going deeply into the protocol stack based on IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoPAN (IETF).

The course includes [lectures](slides/README.md), [laboratories](labs/README.md), and a final project.

## About this teaching material
This course was created ten years ago and has evolved over time.
The last innovation refers updating the laboratories to lab-at-home and material (kits and instrumentation).  
The material available consists of [lectures](slides/README.md) and [laboratories](labs/README.md) (in Spanish).
More information, material, and active discussion forums can be found [here](https://eva.fing.edu.uy/course/view.php?name=rsi).

## Main topics
* Introduction and basic concepts of WSN.
* Introduction to 6LoWPAN communication stack and IPv6
* Hardware platforms
* Software platform (Contiki-NG)
* Physical layer (IEEE 802.15.4 PHY)
* Medium Access Protocols (IEEE 802.15.4 MAC, TSCH and 6TiSCH)
* IPv6 adaptation layer (from IEEE 802.15.4 to IPv6)
* Network Layer (IETF RPL)
* Application Layer (CoAP and MQTT)

## What you will learn
* Main concepts and design challenges on WSN
